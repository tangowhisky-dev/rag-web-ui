# RAG Evaluation

Automated evaluation of retrieval and answer quality using an external test harness.
The harness communicates with the app exclusively over HTTP — it has zero imports from
the RAG codebase and can run on any machine that can reach the API.

---

## Architecture

The harness is split into three files:

```
eval/
├── lib.py            RAGClient, scoring functions, RETRIEVAL_CONFIGS (shared)
├── ingest.py         fetch SQuAD, create KB, upload + wait for processing
├── eval.py           run retrieval configs, score, print table, write JSON
└── requirements.txt  requests, datasets, tqdm
```

Ingest and eval are intentionally separate so the dataset is uploaded once and
evaluation can be re-run against the same KB as many times as needed.

```
┌──────────────┐  ingest.py                     HTTP only

│              │
│              │  eval.py
│              │  6. read ingest_state.json
│              │  7. run queries per config  POST /api/query
│              │  8. score + write report
└──────────────┘
```

The RAG app needs no knowledge of evaluation — it just serves normal API requests.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cd eval
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 1 — ingest once
python ingest.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword \
    --articles 20 --questions 60

# Step 2 — evaluate (repeat as needed, no re-ingest)
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword
```

`ingest.py` writes `ingest_state.json` containing the `kb_id` and question set.
`eval.py` reads it on every run.

---

## Endpoints

Two endpoints were added specifically to support external evaluation.
They live in `backend/app/api/api_v1/query.py`.

### POST /api/query

Stateless RAG query. No chat session is created, nothing is persisted.

**Request**
```json
{
  "question":       "What is Reciprocal Rank Fusion?",
  "kb_ids":         [1, 2],
  "use_dense":      true,
  "use_sparse":     true,
  "use_exact":      true,
  "use_graph_rag":  false,
  "generate_answer": true
}
```

Per-request leg flags AND with the global `.env` settings — a leg only runs when
both the request flag and the server-side `RETRIEVAL_*_ENABLED` flag are true.
Set `generate_answer: false` to measure retrieval quality only (no LLM tokens consumed).

**Response**
```json
{
  "question": "What is Reciprocal Rank Fusion?",
  "answer":   "RRF is a rank fusion method that combines ...",
  "contexts": [
    { "content": "RRF merges ranked lists by ...", "metadata": { "source": "paper.pdf" } }
  ],
  "confidence": "high",
  "suggestion": null,
  "retrieval_info": {
    "legs": {
      "dense":         { "status": "ok",       "count": 6 },
      "qdrant_sparse": { "status": "ok",       "count": 5 },
      "exact":         { "status": "ok",       "count": 4 },
      "graph":         { "status": "disabled", "count": 0 }
    },
    "failed_legs": []
  },
  "latency_ms": 412
}
```

Leg status values: `ok` | `failed` | `disabled`.

**Confidence levels**

| Value      | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `very_high`| Multi-leg agreement, full result set |
| `high`     | Good coverage, minimal failures |
| `medium`   | Partial retrieval or one leg failed |
| `low`      | Sparse results, multiple leg failures |
| `none`     | Zero documents retrieved |

### GET /api/query/kb/{kb_id}/ingest-status

Returns processing readiness for all documents in a knowledge base.
Poll this after triggering document processing; begin queries only when `ready: true`.

**Response**
```json
{
  "kb_id":     3,
  "total":     20,
  "completed": 20,
  "failed":    0,
  "pending":   0,
  "ready":     true
}
```

`ready` is `true` when `total > 0`, `completed == total`, and `failed == 0`.

---

## How RRF works in the eval context

Every chunk that appears in any enabled leg's result list gets a score:

```
rrf_score = Σ  weight_leg / (60 + rank_leg)
             for each leg where the chunk appeared
```

`60` is the smoothing constant from the original paper. Weights come from `.env`:

```
HYBRID_DENSE_WEIGHT          0.5   (dense vectors)
HYBRID_QDRANT_SPARSE_WEIGHT  0.3   (SPLADE sparse vectors)
HYBRID_EXACT_WEIGHT          0.2   (MySQL keyword / FTS)
HYBRID_GRAPH_WEIGHT          0.3   (Neo4j GraphRAG, legacy — not currently used)
```

A chunk absent from a disabled leg contributes 0 from that leg but can still
surface via the remaining legs. With only one leg active, RRF degenerates to
the original ranking of that leg — no fusion happens, which is why single-leg
runs are useful as clean baselines.

**Example — 2 legs enabled (dense + exact):**

```
chunk A: dense_rank=0, exact_rank=2
  score = 0.5/(60+0) + 0.2/(60+2) = 0.00833 + 0.00323 = 0.01156

chunk B: dense_rank=4, exact_rank=0
  score = 0.5/(60+4) + 0.2/(60+0) = 0.00781 + 0.00333 = 0.01114
```

Chunk A wins because top-1 dense (weight 0.5) outweighs top-1 exact (weight 0.2).
Add sparse and the balance shifts again — which is exactly what the harness measures.

## ingest.py

Fetches the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, creates a knowledge base, uploads all articles,
waits for processing to complete, and writes `ingest_state.json`.

### Usage

```bash
python ingest.py \
    --username  eval_user \
    --password  yourpassword \
    --articles  20 \
    --questions 60 \
    --state     ingest_state.json
```

### Flags

| Flag          | Env var    | Default                     | Description |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `--base-url`  | `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/api` | RAG API base URL |
| `--username`  | `USERNAME` | `eval_user`                 | Login username |
| `--password`  | `PASSWORD` | `eval_pass`                 | Login password |
| `--email`     | `EMAIL`    | `eval@example.com`          | Used on first registration |
| `--articles`  | —          | `20`                        | SQuAD articles to ingest |
| `--questions` | —          | `60`                        | Questions to pull from those articles |
| `--state`     | —          | `ingest_state.json`         | Output file path |

### ingest_state.json

```json
{
  "kb_id":      7,
  "n_articles": 20,
  "questions": [
    { "question": "To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear?", "answers": ["Saint Bernadette Soubirous"], "title": "Lourdes" }
  ]
}
```

Keep this file — `eval.py` reads it on every run. You can also edit it manually
to point at a different KB or swap in a different question set.

---

## eval.py

Reads `ingest_state.json`, runs retrieval configs against the KB, scores results,
prints a comparison table, and writes `eval_results.json`.

### Usage

```bash
# Full sweep (all configs)
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword

# Include graph config (requires Neo4j + GraphRAG)
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword --graph

# Single config
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword --use-dense --use-sparse

# With LLM answer generation (slower, costs tokens)
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword --generate-answers

# Custom state file
python eval.py --username eval_user --password yourpassword --state other_state.json
```

### Modes

#### Sweep mode (default — no leg flags)

Runs all predefined retrieval configurations against the same question set.

| Config name    | Legs active                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `exact_only`   | Keyword only (baseline)                  |
| `dense_only`   | Dense vectors only                       |
| `sparse_only`  | Sparse vectors (SPLADE) only             |
| `dense+sparse` | Dense + Sparse, no keyword               |
| `dense+exact`  | Dense + Keyword                          |
| `sparse+exact` | Sparse + Keyword                         |
| `all_3`        | Dense + Sparse + Keyword (full hybrid)   |
| `all_3+graph`  | Full hybrid + Knowledge Graph (opt-in via `--graph`) |

#### Single-config mode (leg flags passed)

Runs exactly one combination. Keyword (`exact`) is always on.

```bash
# dense + keyword
python eval.py --use-dense

# sparse + keyword
python eval.py --use-sparse

# dense + sparse + keyword
python eval.py --use-dense --use-sparse

# everything including graph
python eval.py --use-dense --use-sparse --use-kg
```

## Dataset — SQuAD 2.0

SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) is the standard benchmark for
extractive QA. Each row contains:

- `context`  — a Wikipedia paragraph
- `question` — a question about that paragraph
- `answers`  — one or more correct answer spans extracted from the context

The harness uploads contexts as plain-text documents, queries with the questions,
and scores against the ground truth spans.

SQuAD 2.0 (`squad_v2`) adds unanswerable questions — the harness skips those
automatically (they have empty `answers.text`).

Why SQuAD:
- Free, no API key, cached after first download (~35 MB)
- Ground truth answers are short extractive spans — easy to score without an LLM judge
- Widely used, so scores are comparable across systems

---

## Metrics

### Token-F1

The official SQuAD metric. Computes overlap between predicted and reference answer
at the token level after lowercasing and stripping punctuation.

```
precision = overlap_tokens / predicted_tokens
recall    = overlap_tokens / reference_tokens
F1        = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)
```

Computed as `max(F1)` over all reference answers for a question.

When `--generate-answers` is **off** (default), F1 and EM are scored against the
concatenated retrieved context text rather than a generated answer. This is
*oracle span scoring* — it measures whether the answer tokens are present anywhere
in the retrieved chunks, which is the right signal for benchmarking retrieval
configurations without paying LLM costs.

When `--generate-answers` is **on**, scoring is against the LLM's answer and
reflects end-to-end quality.

### Exact Match

1 if the normalised prediction equals any normalised reference answer, 0 otherwise.
Almost always 0 in oracle-context mode (context is much longer than the answer span).
More meaningful with `--generate-answers`.

### Hit Rate

1 if any ground truth answer string appears (substring match, case-insensitive) in
any retrieved chunk. Measures retrieval quality independent of answer generation —
the primary signal when running without `--generate-answers`.

### Interpreting scores

| Token-F1  | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 0.65    | Good — retrieval and extraction both working |
| 0.40–0.65 | Retrieval probably OK, answer synthesis weak |
| < 0.40    | Likely retrieval misses — check chunk size, embedding model |

- Low F1 + high `confidence: none` count → retrieval not finding the right chunks.
  Try reducing `CHUNK_SIZE`, switching embedding model, or enabling more legs.
- Low F1 + high `confidence: high` count → retrieval is finding chunks but the LLM
  is not extracting correctly. Check the system prompt or model.
- High hit rate + low F1 → chunks contain the answer but the LLM isn't using it.

        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `summary` array is ordered by config and sufficient for a comparison table.
The `details` dict contains per-question breakdowns keyed by config name.

---

## Error handling

- A question that gets an HTTP error is recorded with `error: "<message>"` and
  scores of 0 — it does not abort the run.
- If any document fails processing (`failed > 0` in ingest-status), the harness
  logs a warning and continues — partial KBs are valid for benchmarking purposes.
- Transient `ConnectionError` or `ReadTimeout` during the ingest poll loop are
  retried silently. In `--reload` dev mode, uvicorn briefly drops connections
  when it detects file changes; the poll loop rides through it.
- The KB is **not** deleted after eval. Re-run `ingest.py` to create a fresh one.
