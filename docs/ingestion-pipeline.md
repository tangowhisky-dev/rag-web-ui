# Document Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview

When a document is uploaded it goes through a **9-step pipeline** that ends
with each text chunk stored in three places: Qdrant (for vector search), MySQL
(for full-text search), and optionally Neo4j (for entity/relationship graph
traversal). Every chunk produces exactly **2 vectors** — one dense, one sparse —
stored as named vector fields on a single Qdrant point.

Document parsing is handled by **[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)**
(Microsoft), which converts every supported file type into clean, consistent
Markdown before chunking. This normalises wildly different input formats into a
single representation, so the rest of the pipeline is format-agnostic.

---

## Supported File Formats

All conversion is performed by `markitdown[all]` + `markitdown-ocr`.

| Category | Extensions |
|----------|-----------|
| Documents | `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pptx`, `.ppt`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` |
| Text / Markup | `.txt`, `.md`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.mhtml` |
| Data formats | `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml` |
| Email | `.msg`, `.eml` |
| Books | `.epub` |
| Images (OCR) | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff` |
| Archives | `.zip` (contents processed recursively) |

Files with unsupported extensions are rejected at the API layer with HTTP 400
before any I/O occurs.

---

## Steps

### 1. Upload & Validate

The file is received by `POST /api/knowledge-base/{kb_id}/documents/upload`.

- Extension is checked against `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` — unsupported types return
  HTTP 400 immediately.
- File content is SHA-256 hashed. If an identical file (same name + same hash)
  already exists in the knowledge base it is returned as `status: "exists"` and
  skipped — no re-processing.
- The file is saved to `uploads/user_{uid}/kb_{kb_id}/temp/{filename}` and a
  `DocumentUpload` record is created in MySQL with `status: "pending"`.

### 2. Convert to Markdown

`_convert_to_markdown(abs_path, file_name)` in `document_processor.py`.

MarkItDown is initialised once as a lazy singleton. When `VISION_MODEL` is
set in `.env`, the `markitdown-ocr` plugin is activated and a `SyncOpenAI` client
is passed as `llm_client`. The vision model then automatically OCRs any images
embedded in uploaded documents — scanned PDF pages, photos in DOCX/PPTX/XLSX, or
standalone image uploads. When `VISION_MODEL` is unset, MarkItDown is
initialised without a client and OCR is silently skipped (identical to the
previous behaviour).

Think-block traces (`<think>...</think>`) emitted by reasoning vision models are
stripped from the converted text before it is chunked. Both complete blocks and
truncated unclosed prefixes are handled.

MarkItDown applies the appropriate converter for each file type:

| Input type | What MarkItDown does |
|------------|---------------------|
| PDF | Extracts text and structure, preserves headings |
| Word (docx/doc) | Extracts paragraphs, headings, tables |
| PowerPoint (pptx/ppt) | Extracts slide text, titles, speaker notes |
| Excel (xlsx/xls) | Converts sheets to Markdown tables |
| HTML / MHTML | Strips tags, preserves document structure |
| CSV | Converts to Markdown table |
| JSON | Pretty-prints as fenced code block |
| XML | Preserves structure as formatted text |
| Email (msg/eml) | Extracts headers, body, and attachments |
| EPUB | Extracts chapter text |
| Images | OCR via `markitdown-ocr` using `VISION_MODEL`; skipped when model is unset |
| ZIP | Recursively converts all contained files |

**Fallback:** if MarkItDown raises any exception, `_convert_to_markdown` falls
back to reading the raw file as UTF-8 (with `errors="replace"`). This ensures
the pipeline never hard-fails on a conversion error — degraded output is always
preferred over a processing failure.

**Think-trace stripping:** after conversion the output is passed through two
regex passes to strip `<think>...</think>` blocks that reasoning vision models
may emit during OCR. This keeps thinking noise out of the chunk index.

The resulting Markdown string is wrapped in a single `LangchainDocument` with
`metadata={"source": file_name}` before chunking.

### 3. Chunk

`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with configurable `chunk_size` and
`chunk_overlap` (set via `.env`).

Default values: `CHUNK_SIZE=1500`, `OVERLAP_PERCENTAGE=0.20` → 300-char overlap.

The splitter tries to break on paragraph boundaries first (`\n\n`), then line
breaks (`\n`), then spaces, falling back to raw characters only as a last
resort. The overlap repeats the tail of each chunk at the head of the next,
preserving sentence context across boundaries.

> **Note:** Because MarkItDown produces Markdown output, chunking naturally
> respects structural boundaries like headings and paragraph breaks that are
> present in the converted text.

> **Warning:** `CHUNK_SIZE` and `OVERLAP_PERCENTAGE` must stay consistent
> across all documents in a knowledge base. If you change them after documents
> have been ingested, delete and re-upload existing documents to re-index with
> the new settings.

### 3. Ensure Qdrant Collection

`_ensure_qdrant_collection()` checks whether a collection named `kb_{kb_id}`
already exists in Qdrant. If not, it creates it with two named vector configs:

```
"dense":  VectorParams(size=DENSE_EMBEDDING_DIM, distance=COSINE)
"sparse": SparseVectorParams(index=SparseIndexParams(on_disk=False))
```

This step is idempotent — re-processing an existing document skips creation.

### 4. Move to Permanent Storage

The file is moved from its temp path
(`uploads/user_{uid}/kb_{kb_id}/temp/{filename}`) to its permanent location
(`uploads/user_{uid}/kb_{kb_id}/{filename}`). A `permanent_path` variable tracks
whether this move has occurred so the cleanup logic in the failure path always
deletes the file from its current location.

### 5. Create Document Record

A `Document` ORM record is committed to MySQL with ownership metadata
(`file_name`, `file_path`, `file_hash`, `file_size`, `content_type`,
`knowledge_base_id`). This is the anchor that chunk records will reference.

### 6. Build Chunk Records (deferred commit)

For each chunk a `DocumentChunk` record is added to the SQLAlchemy session and
a Qdrant payload tuple is prepared. The chunk ID is a SHA-256 of
`"{kb_id}:{file_name}:{chunk_text}"` — scoping the ID to the knowledge base so
the same text in two knowledge bases produces different IDs.

**No DB commit happens here.** Chunks remain in the session so that a Qdrant
failure in step 7 can be recovered by rolling back the session, keeping MySQL
and Qdrant in sync.

### 7. Embed and Upsert to Qdrant

Dense and sparse embeddings are computed together in `_upsert_to_qdrant()`, then
flushed to Qdrant. Both embedding calls happen before any DB commit so a network
failure rolls back cleanly.

**Dense embeddings** — chunk texts are sent to the configured OpenAI-compatible
API (`DENSE_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`) in batches of 32. Each chunk produces one
`List[float]` of length `DENSE_EMBEDDING_DIM` (1024 for local models such as
`qwen3-embedding-0.6b`; 1536 for `text-embedding-3-small`).

**Sparse embeddings** — the same texts are passed through FastEmbed's
`SparseTextEmbedding` (`prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1` by default). Each chunk
produces a `SparseVector(indices, values)` in BERT vocabulary space.

See [What sparse vectors represent](#what-sparse-vectors-represent) below.

Each chunk becomes one Qdrant `PointStruct`:

```
PointStruct(
    id      = UUID derived deterministically from SHA-256(chunk_id),
    vector  = {
        "dense":  [float, ...]                             # DENSE_EMBEDDING_DIM floats
        "sparse": SparseVector(indices=[...], values=[...])
    },
    payload = {
        "chunk_text":      "...",
        "kb_id":           <int>,
        "document_id":     <int>,
        "file_name":       "...",
        "chunk_index":     <int>,
        "qdrant_point_id": "<uuid>",   # explicit copy of the point ID for graph cross-reference
        # plus any source metadata — e.g. page number for PDFs
    }
)
```

Points are upserted in batches of 100 (`_QDRANT_UPSERT_BATCH`).

### 8. Commit Chunks + Mark Task Complete

A single `db.commit()` atomically persists all pending chunk records, updates
`task.status = "completed"`, and sets `upload.status = "completed"`. Because
this is the first commit that writes chunks, a Qdrant failure in step 7 rolls
back all chunk state cleanly — the two stores stay in sync.

The chunk text and metadata written here back the `document_chunks` table so
that MySQL's InnoDB FULLTEXT index can serve the exact-search leg at query time.
This is the same table the exact retrieval leg queries with
`MATCH(...) AGAINST(... IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE)`.

### 9. GraphRAG Extraction (optional)

When `GRAPHRAG_ENABLED=true`, `graph_service.extract_graph_for_document()` is
called after the Qdrant+MySQL commit. This step is deliberately **after** the
main commit — a graph extraction failure leaves the document fully searchable
via the 3-leg hybrid pipeline; it does not roll back chunk storage.

**ReLiK backend** (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=relik` in `.env`):

```
For each chunk text:
    POST http://relik:8000/api/relik?text=<chunk>&annotation_type=char&relation_threshold=0.5
    → parse spans (entities) and triplets (relationships)
    → MERGE (:Chunk {qdrant_point_id}) in Neo4j
    → MERGE entity nodes, CREATE relationships
    → CREATE (chunk)-[:FROM_CHUNK]->(entity) edges
```

**LLM backend** (`GRAPHRAG_LLM=<model>` in `.env`):

```
For each chunk text:
    neo4j-graphrag Pipeline:
        LLMEntityRelationExtractor(use_structured_output=True)
            → OpenAI-compatible API with JSON Schema response_format
            → guaranteed Neo4jGraph JSON (no free-form drift)
        Neo4jWriter
            → write Entity nodes + relationships via APOC
    Then:
        MATCH (:__KGBuilder__) nodes just written
        → link to (:Chunk {qdrant_point_id}) via [:FROM_CHUNK]
```

`GRAPHRAG_LLM` takes precedence over ReLiK when both are configured. If both
are unset, this step is silently skipped.

**Neo4j graph schema after extraction:**

```
(:Chunk {qdrant_point_id, document_id, chunk_index, kb_id, file_name})
    -[:FROM_CHUNK]→
(:__Entity__ {name, ...})
    -[:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]→
(:__Entity__ {name, ...})
```

Chunks are the bridge between the vector world (Qdrant, keyed by `qdrant_point_id`)
and the graph world (Neo4j, keyed by the same UUID). This is what makes
`expand_docs_via_graph()` at retrieval time a single index hop rather than a
compound property lookup.

## What Sparse Vectors Represent

SPLADE (SParse Lexical AnD Expansion) maps text into a sparse vector in BERT's
vocabulary space — roughly 30,000 dimensions, one per BERT token. Each non-zero
dimension corresponds to a token ID; its value is a learned importance weight.

Two properties make SPLADE more powerful than raw BM25:

**Learned weighting** — weights come from a transformer fine-tuned for
retrieval, not from raw term counts. Tokens that carry more discriminative
signal in context receive higher weights.

**Query/document expansion** — the model assigns non-zero weight to terms that
are semantically related to the text but may not literally appear in it. A chunk
about "automobiles" might get non-zero weights on "car", "vehicle", "engine".
This bridges the vocabulary gap that kills exact keyword search: a query for
"cars" will still match a document that only says "automobile".

The result is dense-model-quality recall expressed in sparse form — efficient to
index in Qdrant's sparse vector store and fast to score without a full matrix
multiply.

---

## Vectors Per Chunk

**2 vectors per chunk**, stored as two named vector fields on a single Qdrant
point:

| Field | Type | Length | What it captures |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| `dense` | `List[float]` | `DENSE_EMBEDDING_DIM` (1024 or 1536) | Semantic meaning — paraphrases, synonyms |
| `sparse` | `SparseVector` (indices + values) | Variable; ~100–300 non-zeros out of ~30k | Term-weighted keywords + learned expansion |

The sparse vector length varies per chunk. Longer, keyword-rich chunks typically
produce more non-zero entries than short ones. Qdrant stores only the non-zero
entries, so the storage cost scales with actual content density, not vocabulary
size.

---

## Why MarkItDown?

Before MarkItDown, each file type required a separate LangChain loader
(`PyPDFLoader`, `Docx2txtLoader`, `TextLoader`). Adding a new format meant
adding a new dependency and a new code path. The limitations were:

- Only 4 formats supported: PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT
- PDF extraction produced raw text with no structural awareness
- Spreadsheets, presentations, images, and emails were unsupported
- Each loader had different metadata conventions

MarkItDown replaces all loaders with a single call. Benefits:

- **28 formats** from one library, maintained by Microsoft
- **Consistent Markdown output** — headings, tables, and lists are preserved
  as Markdown syntax, which the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` can use as
  natural break points
- **OCR for images** via `markitdown-ocr` — scanned documents and image files
  are readable
- **Graceful fallback** — conversion failures degrade to raw text rather than
  failing the whole task
- **No schema changes** — `chunk_text LONGTEXT` in MySQL and Qdrant's
  text-agnostic vector storage handle Markdown output without modification

## Failure Handling & Atomicity

The background processing function (`process_document_background`) is designed
so that any failure leaves the system in a fully clean state — no orphaned
records, no partial vectors, no stranded files.

### What happens on failure

| Stage | What fails | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Parse (step 1) | `_convert_to_markdown` returns empty string | Raised as `ValueError` — file still at temp path, nothing committed |
| Parse (step 1) | Chunking produces 0 chunks | Raised as `ValueError` — same as above |
| Move to permanent storage (step 4) | `move_file` raises | File still at temp path; temp path is deleted in cleanup |
| Document record commit (step 5) | DB error | Rolled back; file at permanent path is deleted |
| Qdrant upsert (step 7) | Network / API error | Session rolled back — chunk records (never committed) are discarded; Document record deleted; permanent file deleted |

In every case the task is marked `status="failed"` with the error message written
to `task.error_message`, which the UI surfaces to the user.

### Why chunks are committed after Qdrant, not during the loop

The old implementation committed chunks every 100 rows inside the loop. If
Qdrant upsert then failed, MySQL had committed chunks with no matching vectors —
the two stores would be permanently out of sync.

Chunks are now added to the SQLAlchemy session but **not committed** until the
Qdrant upsert succeeds (step 7). A single `db.commit()` at step 8 atomically
persists chunks + task status + upload status together. A failure anywhere
before that point triggers `db.rollback()`, discarding all pending chunk
records cleanly.

### File cleanup always targets the current location

A `permanent_path` variable tracks whether the file has been moved yet. The
cleanup code deletes `permanent_path` if the move succeeded, or `temp_path` if
it had not — so the file is always deleted from wherever it currently is, and
never left orphaned on disk.

### Empty-parse detection

`_convert_to_markdown` never raises — it degrades to raw UTF-8 text on
conversion failure, and returns `""` only if that also fails. To prevent a
zero-text document from silently ingesting as 0 chunks marked "completed", the
pipeline now explicitly raises `ValueError` if:

- the converted text is empty or whitespace-only
- the splitter produces 0 chunks from the converted text

Both errors surface in `task.error_message` and the document is not stored.
