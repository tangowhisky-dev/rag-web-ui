Retrieval confidence scoring.

Two modes depending on whether the reranker is enabled:

── Reranker ON (default) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All docs passed to this function have already cleared the reranker threshold,
so every doc is considered genuinely relevant. Signals:

  A. Top score      (50 pts) — best reranker logit, normalised over [-5, 8]
                               score ≥ 8  → 50 pts (ceiling)
                               score = 0  → 0 pts
                               Linear in between: pts = clamp(score/span, 0, 1) * 50
  B. Doc count      (30 pts) — continuous: min(n / RETRIEVAL_TOP_K, 1.0) * 30
                               Rewards graph-expanded pools proportionally;
                               saturates at top_k docs (30 pts), not capped at 3.
  C. Mean score     (20 pts) — mean logit of all passing docs, same normalisation
                               as A. Penalises cases where one good chunk is
                               surrounded by many marginal ones.

── Reranker OFF ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Falls back to the original four-signal model based on retrieval leg metadata:

  A. Source coverage    (30 pts) — fraction of enabled legs that returned results
  B. Cross-leg agreement (35 pts) — fraction of top-k chunks confirmed by ≥2 legs
  C. Volume fill rate   (25 pts) — docs returned / RETRIEVAL_TOP_K
  D. Source diversity   (10 pts) — unique source files, capped at 3

Score → level (both modes)
  ≥ 80  very_high
  ≥ 55  high
  ≥ 30  medium
  >  0  low
     0  none

The same function is used by chat_service.py (streaming chat) and query.py
(stateless eval endpoint) so the logic is never duplicated.
